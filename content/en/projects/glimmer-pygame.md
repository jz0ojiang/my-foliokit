## Project Introduction

Glimmer is a side-scrolling dodge game developed with Python + Pygame. Created as an entry for the "Python Creative Programming" competition during my student years, it ultimately won first prize.

The gameplay is simple: players navigate between upper and lower spaces through jumping and gravity switching, avoiding obstacles to extend survival time and achieve higher scores.

## Core Features

- Upper and lower gravity switching mechanism, enriching game interaction;
- Dynamic difficulty control with obstacle generation frequency and speed increasing with score;
- Modular architecture including resource management, state control, and UI systems;
- Custom sound effects and music control with configuration file persistence;
- Scrolling background and basic physics-based jumping for immersive experience.

## Development Process

The project started in late April 2021 and took about a week to complete the initial version. Development progressed from UI system and player controls to sound effects, and finally to menu and scoring mechanisms. The commit history covers all development details, including:
- UI upload and refinement;
- Game main logic and event loop implementation;
- Difficulty curve adjustment and bug fixes;
- Final demo integration and release.

## Project Reflection

Although an early work with relatively crude code structure and art, Glimmer helped me establish a foundation in game development and modular design, while also accumulating practical experience for the later Nautical project.
