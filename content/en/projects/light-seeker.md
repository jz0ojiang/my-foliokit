This is a visual web project created for a teaching competition. The project was independently designed and developed by me, serving as a practical case study for demonstrating web structure and artistic layout during HTML/CSS course instruction.

The page features a full-screen background video with centered calligraphy-style typography, creating an inspiring atmosphere centered around the theme of "worker's spirit."

The page structure is clean and straightforward, suitable for classroom demonstrations or promotional purposes.

This project represents one of my early explorations of the "emotion-oriented + full-screen first-screen" design formula, which later became a reference for the style of many subsequent pages.

The page is static with no complex interactions.
