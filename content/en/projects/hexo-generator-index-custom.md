## Project Introduction

`hexo-generator-index-custom` is a customized plugin based on the official Hexo index generator, adding two commonly used features:

- `top` and `sticky`: Support article pinning through front-matter;
- `hide`: Support hiding specific articles from the homepage.

To adapt to mainstream themes (such as Butterfly), the plugin prioritizes reading the `top` field while maintaining compatibility with `sticky`; it also prevents hidden articles from occupying homepage pagination.

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Hexo's `generator` extension lifecycle to take over `index` page logic;
- Implements custom pinning sorting rules (supports `top` and `sticky` priority);
- Utilizes front-matter custom fields to control article rendering;
- Published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-generator-index-custom), supporting independent installation and configuration.
